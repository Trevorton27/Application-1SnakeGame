APPLICATION #1: SNAKE GAME
Description
For your first application we are going to keep it light and fun.
You are going to recreate the classic Snake game using only Javascript. This will allow you to work on your basic Javascript skills and focus on the basic patterns for writing code.
Despite the relative simplicity of the game, there are many aspects that you may find challenging as you begin to build your game.
Focus intently on completing the deliverables below and focusing on working through one small problem at a time. And have fun with it!
